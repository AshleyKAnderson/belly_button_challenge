# Project Description
This project builds an interactive dashboard using D3.js to explore a belly button microbiome dataset from [North Carolina State University Public Science Lab](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Users can analyze individual samples through dynamic charts and uncover the most prevalent microbial communities. By visualizing demographic data alongside the microbes, the dashboard provides a richer context for understanding these ecosystems. 

# Dashboard
Explore the dashboard to find out more about microbial ecosytems in your belly button: [Belly Button Microbial Ecosystem](https://ashleykanderson.github.io/belly_button_challenge/)

# Applications Used
* <ins>D3.js</ins> for the manipulation of data
* Plotly.js for creating dynamic visualizations
* Bootstrap for design

# Main Elements
Demographic Panel: displays selected participants information
Horizontal Bar Chart: displays the "Top 10 Microbial Species Found (OTUs)" 
Bubble Chart: displays range of bacteria found in participants belly button 
Guage chart: displays the weekly washing frequency of each participant

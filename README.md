#Project Description
This project builds an interactive dashboard using D3.js to explore a belly button microbiome dataset. Users can analyze individual samples through dynamic charts and uncover the most prevalent microbial communities. By visualizing demographic data alongside the microbes, the dashboard provides a richer context for understanding these ecosystems. 

#Dashboard
